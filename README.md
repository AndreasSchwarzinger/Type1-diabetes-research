# Type I Diabetes Research Project

## üìå Overview
This project explores prohormone processing in Type I diabetes, conducted during my reserch internship with the Type-I pathology group at Helmholtz Institute in Munich under Dr.Teresea Rodriguez-Calvo.
The goal of this project was to investigate potential dysfunctions in insulin processing within the Type I diabetic pancreas and to present findings that may inform the development of improved treatment strategies and approaches for earlier detection of the disease.

## üî¨ Background
- Type-I Diabetes is an Autoimmune disease shown to result from both genetic and environmental factors where our immunesystem targets insulin producing Beta-Cells in the pancrease which leads to insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and Beta-cell dysfunctionality.
-  Type-I Diabetes required life long Insulin treatment. Type-I Diabetes affects approximately 9.5 million people globally, with children and adolescents being most affected. T1D incidence and prevalance have steadily increased, and the underlying causes are still not clear. 
- Prohormone processing research is critical in advancing our understanding of Type I diabetes because disruptions in insulin maturation represent some of the earliest molecular events in the disease. By identifying and characterizing these dysfunctions, researchers can uncover potential biomarkers for early detection, enabling interventions before complete pancreatic beta-cell loss.

For physicians, this knowledge supports more accurate diagnosis, patient stratification, and treatment monitoring, ultimately guiding personalized therapy. For the healthcare technology sector, these findings provide the foundation for developing innovative tools, from diagnostic assays and biosensors to AI-driven predictive models and digital monitoring platforms ‚Äî that can translate biological insights into clinical practice.

In medicine more broadly, linking molecular dysfunction to patient outcomes has the potential to improve long-term management, reduce complications, and lower healthcare costs, making prohormone processing research highly relevant to the future of Type I diabetes care.

## üß™ Methods
- Study type: Lab research, data-analysis, and literature review. 
- Data: The Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD) provides high-quality human pancreatic tissue for research.
- Their process includes:Harvesting pancreases from organ donors, Cutting small tissue blocks and embedding them in agarose. Sectioning thin slices using a vibratome, preserving: Islet architecture, Exocrine tissue, Microvasculature, Immune cell populations, Maintaining live slices in culture media for up to 12 hours. Stimulating a portion of slices with glucose to collect perfusate for downstream analysis.This system preserves the native tissue architecture and cellular interactions, providing a unique ex vivo platform for studying Type I diabetes in real human tissue.
- 15 Non-Diabetic Donors, 10T1D Donors and 5 Auto-Antibody Postive Donors. 

- Analysis:   QuPath + Python: Whole-slide images were imported into QuPath, a digital pathology platform.
Custom Python scripts were used to: Segment islets and surrounding tissue. Assess proinsulin-to-insulin ratios. Map immune cell infiltration. This workflow enables quantitative, reproducible analysis across multiple donors and markers

## üìä Key Findings
- **Result 1: After Glucose Stimulation, Insulin area increases in non-diabetics and autoantibody-postive samples but   decreases in T1D, reflecting impaired insulin processing or secretion in T1D.
